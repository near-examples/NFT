            <h1>WebAssembly Music on NEAR protocol</h1>
            <p>
                Everything you see and hear here is stored in a <a href="https://explorer.near.org/accounts/psalomo.near">smart contract</a>
                on the NEAR protocol blockchain. The instruments are generated in real time from tiny WebAssembly programs suitable for storing
                directly on-chain. Web app content for playing, mixing and editing music is also stored in the same smart contract.<br>
                This means that the lifespan of what you find here does not depend on some maintainer subscribing to cloud or hosting services,
                but rather on the blockchain.
